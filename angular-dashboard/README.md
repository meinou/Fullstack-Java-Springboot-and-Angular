# This application implements task board with the idea similar to jira. Different types of tickets creates by (imagine that by front page of same app which does not exist at the moment) the backend and presented as:

## Ticket of certain type in a list of all the tickets of this type

## Notification with a time of ticket creation

# Each ticket has it's own page and can be marked as "resolved". In this case ticket doesn't appear in list of unresolved ticket anymore.
Next time notification of ticket has been changed should fire

# Statistics visulizated for a period of month back since first day of current month
